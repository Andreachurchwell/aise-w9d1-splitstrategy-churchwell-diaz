Week 9 Split Strategy Showdown
# 🧪 AISE Week 9 — Split Strategy Showdown  
### **Team: Andrea Churchwell & Jose Diaz**

---

## 📌 Project Overview
This repository contains our team implementation for the **W9D1 Split Strategy Showdown** assignment.  
The goal of the project is to compare multiple evaluation strategies using the **same dataset**, the **same model**, and the **same metric**, and then analyze how each approach affects performance, variance, and overall reliability.

We are currently in the **environment setup and repository scaffolding phase**.  
Dataset selection and modeling will begin next.

## ✅ Current Progress

### ✔ Repository Created
- `aise-w9d1-splitstrategy-churchwell-diaz` initialized  
- `.gitignore` created  
- Project folder structure created in VS Code  

### ✔ Virtual Environment Setup
- Python virtual environment created: `venv/`  
- Core dependencies installed  
- `requirements.txt` generated via `pip freeze`  
- Git configured to ignore the virtual environment  

### ✔ Assignment Scaffolding Added
- The following required files have been created and will be populated as we progress:
- TEAM_INFO.md
- eval_partner_a.py
- eval_partner_b.py
- comparison.csv
- RECOMMENDATION.md


### ✔ README placeholder added  
You’re reading it now — this will grow as the project evolves.

## ⏳ Next Steps

### 🔸 **1. Confirm Dataset Choice**
We will select one of the approved datasets (e.g., Breast Cancer, Credit Card Default, Iris, etc.).  
All partners must use the *same* dataset.

### 🔸 **2. Agree on a Single Metric**
Example metrics:  
- Classification: ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, F1  
- Regression: MAE, RMSE, R²  

### 🔸 **3. Populate TEAM_INFO.md**
This will include:
- Partner roles  
- Dataset choice  
- Metric choice  
- Dataset loading code  
- Package versions  

### 🔸 **4. Implement Partner A & Partner B Scripts**
- Partner A: Random 80/20 + KFold  
- Partner B: Stratified or TimeSeriesSplit + specialized 5-fold  

### 🔸 **5. Generate comparison.csv**
Both partner results will be added in a structured table.

### 🔸 **6. Write RECOMMENDATION.md**
Final analysis comparing variance, stability, leakage risk, and trustworthiness.
